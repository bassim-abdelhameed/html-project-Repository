  ●Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare:
 </br> Companies are applying machine learning to make better and faster diagnoses than humans. One of the best-known technologies is IBM’s Watson. It understands natural language and can respond to questions asked of it. The system mines patient data and other available data sources to form a hypothesis, which it then presents with a confidence scoring schema. AI is a study realized to emulate human intelligence into computer technology that could assist both, the doctor and the patients in the following ways:
<ul><li> By providing a laboratory for the examination, representation and cataloguing medical information </li>
<li> By devising novel tool to support decision making and research. </li>
<li> By integrating activities in medical, software and cognitive sciences. </li>
<li> By offering a content rich discipline for the future scientific medical communities. </li></ul>
</br>●Artificial Intelligence in business:
</br> Robotic process automation is being applied to highly repetitive tasks normally performed by humans. Machine learning algorithms are being integrated into analytics and CRM (Customer relationship management) platforms to uncover information on how to better serve customers. Chatbots have already been incorporated into websites and e companies to provide immediate service to customers. Automation of job positions has also become a talking point among academics and IT consultancies.
</br>
</br>●AI in Autonomous vehicles: 
</br>  Just like humans, self-driving cars need to have sensors to understand the world around them and a brain to collect, processes and choose specific actions based on information gathered. Autonomous vehicles are with advanced tool to gather information, including long range radar, cameras, and LIDAR. Each of the technologies are used in different capacities and each collects different information. This information is useless, unless it is processed and some form of information is taken based on the gathered information.
